        <p>📑 Descriere: Now I'm secretely working on another project - this time targeted at devs - while also teaching Web Technologies & Client-Side Web Development laboratories at the local university. When I'm not coding or teaching I'm probably hanging
            out with my worderful girlfriend, or biking around town - a habbit I picked up while living in Netherlands. </p>
        <p>🏋️‍♂ Interese: I'm inspired by the community and strive to have a positive impact in it as well! There are a couple of devs that particularly inspire me the most, so here's a list of their Twitter handles in case you want to follow them too.
            Before working for myself I used to work as a Front-end developer at Yonder, where I was very fortunate to have colleagues and mentors that helped me get to where I am now. I also used to be part of a small start-up - Werit - which I've build
            together with 3 college friends. Although we've now closed the project, as the main Front-end developer in the team I learned a ton of things about building a production-ready app from the ground-up as well as team-management and a little
            business.
